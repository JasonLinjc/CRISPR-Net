description: This repository includes a recurrent convolutional neural network named
  CRISPR-Net for predicting the off-targets activities with insertions, deletions
  and mismatches in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. There are two command-line tools that
  can be used to quantify the off-target activities induced by CRISPR guide RNA. One
  is CRISPR_Net.py which can predict the off-target activities with indels and mismatches,
  the other is CRISPR_Net_Aggregate.py which aggregates the gRNA-target scores from
  CRISPR-Net into a single consensus off-target score.
